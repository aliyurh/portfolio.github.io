<p>Born on December 9th of 2007, I am currently 15 years old. My full name is Thoersnine Aliyah Escraman, but because of how people often struggle to say my first name, I mostly just go by Aliyah; but I also go by the nickname “Iyah.” </p>

<p>My goal in life is to pursue astronomy and computer science, though the irony is that I don’t do too well when it comes to math. But I’m always determined to learn more about it so I can pursue the career path that I want for myself.</p>
            
<p>I’ve always wanted to be an astronomer, and my inspiration is none other than the astronomer, philosopher, and mathematician, Hypatia (she was born back in 350–370 AD).</p>

<p>My hobbies include coding, reading books (sometimes), creative writing, and playing the piano. I’m still learning the instrument, as well as the violin so I haven’t mastered my skills yet.</p>

<p>I’m quite invested in Greek Mythology as well, and have read a few stories/books about it. One of which include Madeline Miller’s Song of Achilles. It is a story based on the infamous warrior of Greece during his time--Achilles. </p>

<p>It follows both him and his companion, Patroclus, on their journey to the war of Troy, only to end in a tragedy.</p>
