            <p>I was born on the Philippines, and both my parents are Filipino which makes me a pure-blood Filipino as well. I was born in the city of Cebu and moved to Cagayan De Oro City, or CDO. It was in CDO that I grew up and spent most of my childhood in.</p>
            
            <p>In my culture, we have a common gesture to show our respect towards elders (indicated in the picture above). It is called “Mano” and is referred to as “bless” in English. It is performed as a sign of respect towards elders and as a way of accepting a blessing from the elder.</p>
            
            <p>It is usually done towards those who are older by two generations or more. I do this whenever I enter a friend’s house, or to visitors who choose to visit our home.</p>

            <p>In the Philippines, we have many traditional festivities such as “Sinulog.” It is an annual cultural and religious festival held on the third Sunday of January in Cebu City and is the centre of the Santo Niño Catholic Christian celebrations. </p>
